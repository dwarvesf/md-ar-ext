**Estimated Timeline:** 4 weeks

## 2. Documentation Implementation

**Priority: High**

Phase 3 documentation is still pending completion. Required deliverables:

- [ ] Comprehensive user documentation with examples and tutorials
- [ ] Developer documentation for extension architecture
- [ ] API documentation for all public interfaces
- [ ] Code comments and JSDoc across the codebase
- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect current implementation

**Estimated Timeline:** 3 weeks

**Estimated Timeline:** 6 weeks

## Implementation Roadmap

The improvements are organized into three phases:

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Weeks 1-6)
- Testing Completion
- Documentation Implementation
- Error Handling and User Experience

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (Weeks 7-16)
- Batch Processing
- Statistics Dashboard
- Advanced Image Editing
- Performance Optimizations
- Wallet Management Enhancements

### Phase 3: Platform Expansion (Weeks 17-24)
- Dependency and Platform Updates
- Extended Integration Support

## Progress Tracking

A GitHub project board will be set up to track the progress of each improvement area with the following columns:
- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Review
- Done

Regular milestone reviews will be conducted every two weeks to assess progress and adjust priorities as needed.

## Resource Requirements

The following resources are estimated for implementing this improvement plan:

- **Development:** 2 full-time developers
- **Testing:** 1 part-time QA specialist
- **Documentation:** 1 part-time technical writer
- **Design:** Occasional UI/UX design consultations

## Risk Assessment

Potential risks and mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Dependency conflicts with newer versions | Medium | Medium | Create comprehensive test suite before upgrading |
| Performance degradation with new features | High | Low | Implement performance benchmarks and testing |
| Cross-platform compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Set up automated testing on all target platforms |
| Arweave API changes | High | Low | Build abstraction layer for blockchain interactions |

## Success Metrics

The following metrics will be used to measure the success of this improvement plan:

- Test coverage percentage (target: >90% unit, >80% integration)
- Number of open issues and bugs (target: <10 at any time)
- User adoption rate (target: 20% growth)
- Performance benchmarks (target: <3 seconds for image processing)
- Documentation completeness (target: 100% of public APIs documented)
